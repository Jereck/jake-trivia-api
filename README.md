# Trivia API
The Trivia API was built through the Udacity Fullstack Nanodegree.

The app allows one to:

1) Display questions - [all questions or by category]. Each questoin card shows the question, category and difficulty and can show/hide the answer. 
2) Delete questions
3) Add questions (it is required that they include question and answer text)
4) Search for questions by question text
5) You can also play a quiz, answering random questions by either all or specific categories

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.8

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

Working within a virtual environment is recommended.

#### PIP Dependencies

navigate to the `/backend` directory and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages in the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 

## Database Setup
With Postgres running, restore a database using the trivia.psql file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:
```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

## Running the server

From within the `backend` directory

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```


## Testing
To run the tests, run
```
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```

#### Frontend Dependencies

This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. from the `frontend` directory run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Frontend in Dev Mode

The frontend app was built using create-react-app. In order to run the app in development mode use ```npm start```. You can change the script in the ```package.json``` file. 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

```bash
npm start
```
